## Also, a few other notes I wanted to add:
- The goal here was to give a streamlined approach. As you learn things, you will naturally go on some tangents down different areas. That is not only okay, but actually encouraged as an important part of learning.
- Try not to feel overwhelmed by everything. Take it 1 step at a time, using 1-2 primary resources for each step.
- Note that you don’t necessarily need to learn everything in all of these steps, particularly the later ones. That said, I wanted to include it all for more completeness.
- I mention SEO and performance both as key benefits of SSR in the video. But I wanted to add that these topics are not necessarily linked to each other. Learning about both SEO and performance optimizations can be a great step towards improving your skills! Also, there’s plenty of other benefits to SSR.
